# What's this?

While its main premise is to be a keylogger, in comparison to my previous c-library based keylogger, this program steers 
a little bit more into the spyware realm given its features. The majority of the features in this malware run off of an interval
timer.

# Features

As of right now:

- Key press logging
- Screenshots
- Clipboard grabbing
- Default microphone device recording
- Sysinfo grabbing

# Future plans going forward

This may likely be "it" for this specific malware program, and I may move onto another one entirely. Regardless, the plans going
forward for my next project or this one are to add:

- Persistance
- Executable format (probably with Pyinstaller)
- Basic obfuscation
- Emailing all outputs and then cleaning up after itself before running again
